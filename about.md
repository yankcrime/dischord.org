Senior Technical Lead at [StackHPC](http://stackhpc.com), working on cloud capability for scientific and research computing applications.

Find me over [here](http://twitter.com/yankcrime) on Twitter, [here](http://github.com/yankcrime) on GitHub, or if you really must then [here](http://uk.linkedin.com/in/nickj) on LinkedIn.  And in case it wasn't already clear, opinions etc. expressed on this site are entirely my own don't necessarily represent those of my employer.

This uses Jekyll and the theme is based on [Poole](https://github.com/poole/) by [Mark Otto](http://www.markdotto.com).  During the course of pairing it back and making it as simple as possible I inadvertently made it look like his own personal site.  I might have even cribbed some of his CSS in order to tidy a few things up, but I doubt he cares.  Credit where credit's due though!
