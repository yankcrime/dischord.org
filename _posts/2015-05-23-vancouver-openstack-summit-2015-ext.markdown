It's a fair old way to go for just a week's stay, but the pain of long-distance travel was more than worthwhile for an opportunity to attend the first OpenStack Summit of 2015, and to soak up some of the sights and sounds that the fantastic city of Vancouver has to offer.

The Summit itself was extraordinarily well attended, with record numbers again - over 6000 people by the official count.  Fortunately Vancouver's Convention Centre was well prepared to handle such a large number of people and did an amazing job hosting such an event.

As far as our attendance goes, the recent efforts towards making operator involvement more prominent have really paid off, and we found that the ops-focussed sessions in particular on the Tuesday and Wednesday were extremely useful, with the opportunity to provide feedback and discuss problems and ideas directly with various developers and other fellow cloud operators of all shapes and sizes.

Highlights for me had to be hearing a developer from Pivotal discuss how they were placing direct emphasis on RabbitMQ's role within most OpenStack deployments, from assisting with code through to documentation and suggested best practices.  There was also a lot of discussion around the pain of multi-region OpenStack installations (something that's going to be a focus for us over the next few months) and what various large-scale implementers had found to work best with some hard-learned lessons.

It was also fantastic to see some recognition for our work.  We were there on the list as one of the first sixteen companies to have successfully passed the interoperability tests ahead of the Summit, the notion of which being something very close to our hearts and key to the success of not only OpenStack itself but also other public cloud providers such as ourselves.  Our partnership with the ATLAS project at the University of Lancaster also found us with an oblique reference during <<>>'s presentation on the role of OpenStack in High-Energy Physics.  Seeing DataCentred's name up there as one of the biggest contributors to OpenStack clouds in Europe when it comes to processing workloads of data acquired from the LHC was a proud moment indeed.
