This past weekend saw Duxford and the [IWM](http://www.iwm.org.uk/visits/iwm-duxford) host an airshow dedicated to the 75th anniversary of
the Battle of Britain.  It was an incredible event with the sun shining almost all day long - here's
a few of the photos that I managed to take throughout the day:

That last photo is mostly the closest I was able to get to capturing all 17 (!) Spitfires that took
to the sky for the show's finale.  Seeing and hearing all of those incredible machines in the sky at
the same time was a singular experience.  

Thanks again to the IWM for putting a fantastic show on, and there's a few more photos in the series
