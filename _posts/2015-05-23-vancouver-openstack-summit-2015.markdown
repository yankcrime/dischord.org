It's a fair old way to go for just a week's stay, but the pain of long-distance travel was more than worthwhile for an opportunity to attend the first [OpenStack Summit](https://www.openstack.org/summit/vancouver-2015/) of 2015, and to soak up some of the sights and sounds that the fantastic city of Vancouver has to offer.  Here's a few photos I snapped during the bits of time we did have free away from the Summit itself:
