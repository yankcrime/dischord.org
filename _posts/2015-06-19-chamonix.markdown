[Chris](http://www.chamonixit.com) and Catherine's wedding was the perfect excuse to spend a few days in and around Chamonix.  The weather couldn't have been any better for the big day, but the rest of the time it was a bit hit-and-miss and meant that our trip up the Aiguille du Midi wasn't ideal for sweeping vistas of the valley:

Still, the [ScanmaN](http://dischord.org/misc/minorthreat/scanman.htm) came fully prepared with apple vodka, wine, and baguettes - so what was the problem again exactly?
