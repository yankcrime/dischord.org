Whoah, 2018?!  Here's some photos taken last weekend, whilst stood baking in the sunshine, at RAF Fairford for the Royal International Air Tattoo:

There's a bunch more over on [Flickr here](https://flic.kr/s/aHsmjnJ8of).  Be grateful that the album only consists of 87 images - I actually took nearly 1600 photos over the course of two days.

I also came to realise that my Nikon D700 is now nearly 10 years old!  I'm probably due for some kind of upgrade...
